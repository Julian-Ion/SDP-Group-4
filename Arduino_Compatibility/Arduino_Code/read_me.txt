The ino file 'arduino_motor_controller.ino' has to sent over the the arduino on each compile. 
It will store the code so if no changes are made to this file, it will suffice to press the 'reset' button on the board to rerun code.
Also, it will insist on being in its own folder. Still not sure why...
